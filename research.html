                                <p class="content-text">Galaxies are known to host super massive black holes (SMBH) at their centre. These are black holes which have masses of the order of millions times the solar mass. But the mass of the black hole itself is seen to be a very very tiny fraction of the mass of the galaxy. But observations show that the mass of the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...539L...9F/abstract">central black hole is correlated with the motion of gas and stars in the farthest reaches of the visible galaxy</a> . This cannot be explained gravitationally and hence the idea of AGN feedback jumps in. It is seen in galaxy clusters that the SMBH is often accreting matter around it and hence is radiating and such a SMBH is called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.2152.pdf">These AGN energy outputs show significant effect on the gas properties of the clusters</a> . Similar effect is expected and has been observed in galaxy scales. The energy output of the AGN itself can couple with the contents of its host galaxy and hence can influence various properties of the galaxy including the gas content of the galaxy itself. It is believed that the AGN through its feedback can play an important but complex role in the growth and evolution of its host galaxy. Multiple probes to observationally study the feedback mechanism exists. I work on X-ray signatures of AGN feedback on galaxies. The gas falling in the dark matter gravitational potential of the galaxy emits diffuse X-rays. But if the galaxy hosts an AGN, through its feedback mechanism it will push the gas radially outwards. Hence one expects to see a deficit of X-ray emission around AGN compared inactive SMBH hosting galaxies. We have observed this effect in high redshift (0.3-0.6) galaxies using Chandra and DEEP-2 data. Please look through my Publications page for the relevant paper. </p>

                                <p class="content-text"> Exoplanets are planets orbiting other stars than our sun - planets exterior to our solar system. The first exoplanet detection via radial velocity technique has been awarded the 2019 shared Nobel prize in physics. There are various methods to detect exoplanets including studying the slight motion of the host star due to the gravitational tug of the planet rotating around it- the radial velocity technique. If the planet transits the star along our line of sight then one expects to see a very small decrease in the luminosity of the star-planet system due to the planet blocking a tiny fraction of star light. This is called transit method. Direct imaging of exoplanets and gravitational micro-lensing studies are also promising methods of detection. Like our solar system planets, exoplanets are also expected to host atmospheres. When the star light is incident on the planet atmosphere it might pass directly through it and carry various physical and chemical signatures of the atmospheres to us. Studying this light spectroscopically is called transit spectroscopy and has been very instrumental to gain key insights into the contents of upper atmospheres of exoplanets. Planets are formed by gravitational collapse of matter around stars and the gravitational energy change due to this collapse causes the planet cores to have some residual heat energy. This heat energy along with the energy input from the stellar radiation results in a planet having a effective temperature and a thermal emission due to this temperature. Star light can also get reflected from the planet atmosphere and reach the atmosphere and this is called reflection spectroscopy. Detection of reflected light is very challenging since we need cooler planets closer to host stars which is a difficult combination by itself. But reflected light can help in constraining key scattering properties of planet atmospheres including the structure of clouds in these atmospheres and day-night temperature contrasts. We are working on the modeling of reflected and thermal light from planet atmospheres using modules like <a href="https://natashabatalha.github.io/picaso/index.html">PICASO</a>. Upcoming <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">JWST</a> can help in detection and study of reflected light and we are trying to simulate mock JWST observations from our model. We are also working on a Python based cloud model for exoplanets which will be publicly available soon. We are running some retrieval algorithms on simulated spectra for future direct imaging and spectrscopy missions like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/wfirst-wide-field-infrared-survey-telescope"> WFIRST </a>. Keep an eye on the Publication page for upcoming publications on these. </p>
