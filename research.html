                            Exoplanets are planets orbiting other stars than our sun - planets exterior to our solar system. Like our solar system planets, exoplanets can also host atmospheres. There are multiple methods to study their atmospheres. For example, when the star light incident on the planet's atmosphere passes through it, it can carry information about its physical state and 
                            and chemical contents to us. Studying this light spectroscopically is called transit spectroscopy and has been very instrumental to gain key insights into the contents of exoplanetary atmospheres. Planets also emit their own thermal emission due to their temperature. This thermal emission can be detected to study their atmospheres using techniques like direct imaging and eclipse spectroscopy. 
                            Star light can also get reflected from the planet atmosphere and reach the observer. Studying this reflected light is called reflection spectroscopy. 
                            I work on developing theoretical models of exoplanet atmospheres that can be used to simulate the transmission spectrum, thermal emission spectrum, reflected light spectrum and polarization signature of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. 
                            These theoretical models are available and open-sourced in the <a href="https://natashabatalha.github.io/picaso/index.html">PICASO</a> repository.
                            I use these theoretical models to find ways to measure atmospheric contents and properties of these far-away worlds. I work on varied type of exoplanets and substellar objects like gas giant exoplanets, sub-Neptunes, and brown dwarfs.
                            I use these models to explain, understand, and make inferences from observations of these worlds from space-based and ground-based telescopes like JWST, HST, Keck, Gemini, etc. 
                            Please get in touch with me if you, like me, also wonder about the physics and chemistry of these worlds and their atmospheres !  </p>

                        <p class="content-text"> <a> Galaxies are known to host super massive black holes (SMBH) at their centre. These are black holes which have masses of the order of millions times the solar mass. But the mass of the black hole itself is seen to be a very very tiny fraction of the mass of the galaxy. But observations show that the mass of the </a><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...539L...9F/abstract">central black hole is correlated with the motion of gas and stars in the farthest reaches of the visible galaxy</a> . This cannot be explained gravitationally and hence the idea of AGN feedback jumps in. It is seen in galaxy clusters that the SMBH is often accreting matter around it and hence is radiating and such a SMBH is called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.2152.pdf">These AGN energy outputs show significant effect on the gas properties of the clusters</a> . Similar effect is expected and has been observed in galaxy scales. The energy output of the AGN itself can couple with the contents of its host galaxy and hence can influence various properties of the galaxy including the gas content of the galaxy itself. It is believed that the AGN through its feedback can play an important but complex role in the growth and evolution of its host galaxy. Multiple probes to observationally study the feedback mechanism exists. I work on X-ray signatures of AGN feedback on galaxies. The gas falling in the dark matter gravitational potential of the galaxy emits diffuse X-rays. But if the galaxy hosts an AGN, through its feedback mechanism it will push the gas radially outwards. Hence one expects to see a deficit of X-ray emission around AGN compared inactive SMBH hosting galaxies. We have observed this effect in high redshift (0.3-0.6) galaxies using Chandra and DEEP-2 data.

                        <p class="content-text"> Black holes feed on the matter in their surroundings. Infalling matter on the black hole loose their gravitational energy through radiation forming disk like structures called accretion disks. These accretion disks have been spectroscopically inferred in many solar mass black hole and AGN (SMBH) systems. Blazars are black hole systems where the jet outflows from the BH points at a very small angle to our line of sight. Blazars emit across a huge range of wavelengths from radio to very high energy gamma rays. Blazars also show time variability in various timescales - from hours to years. Modeling Spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars show that the emission in blazars are from ultra-relativistic particles which are traveling at speeds very close to the speed of light. These particles emit radiation through processes like Synchroton and Inverse- Compton radiation. Accretion disks also show variability in a large number of timescales. The origin of these highly relativistic jet outflows are not well understood. Since they originate very close to the central engine and the only source of matter in that region is the matter in the accretion disk, it is thought that the matter around the accretion disk gets accelerated and collimated as a jet through complex processes. If this is so, one might expect to observe certain temporal connection between the variability of accretion disks and jets. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2051"> Chatterjee et al. (2009) </a> and several other studies have observed such connections in Seyferts. Disk variability also is well known to show a characteristic timescale related with black hole mass observed by <a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/359-4-1469.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAm8wggJrBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJcMIICWAIBADCCAlEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMPL8hp6ybXmzn3o9RAgEQgIICIqOXBmLC-rZAfMgsZpnY__Oeu0n_DSMBNm9Ht_q0eUcSlk34n7m2vvhi74D1Ox1c52vtEMeA7NaFPGwnxqgQeU85ml2YKzxPuiHysYxB3saoYVZ43AqUeOiKyaGKX-9PC33C-kZqRuAlvOEB1abx16uZrj19mjfuuUtRbouxlUR4wpLYGuIDxm5uyDGDyQVGV2Ydr6s9Yv9-MTqtxX5hJzrW8_4-tQa2UN4kuJEfc2-qOHevm_fx5DZpVlrdkOjsY8IW-KCTto1MCC2W1NHNc4SNxc6HLn4s_OqEbpgJHhou2qU7GwyZ0yRIDHUw7fyK8oKAbdhiRTD1OYK2V5J0tDg5K8BvyUUthk2rGG5EVF4cIHt1bQv0GOVJakYRtftqAsmiWEstriOUD-EJWkvmn3MSmlW2TOaAVPKRcYsOYu7uFpq43XnUHQef6Dr6419sjQZvH2iQ6B43weY_6IQ4EgDBMane1tKIzdHGnhf92agQJ_Kxe6jwy1AZTquq9-latkCjWsQPWJQC1IS4j3vnphUPtGtQuJc09e3N0Jp2cEhYgDIFlEO1Bc-BS4d8ndqBvfiolbjrrPo6izElEcac1SpDISX3oJd0h8P2ZspfsspclG6M7lILaJWiw0BSdQNXz1cL_-_GJMwZfsbOsKG-86Q44uLXe9gNJaB4FFgKtWosByx1NtLeXxO8arBpxz4eWW70BFuWZVthRq7apC669P8gIA"> McHardy et al (2005) </a>. Recently, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aac48a/meta"> Chatterjee et al. (2018) </a> observed a similar characteristic timescale in jet variability as well.

                        <p class="content-text"> Andromeda galaxy is our nearest major galaxy. It is the most massive galaxy in the local group of galaxies. It's proximity is extremely helpful for us since this provides us the opportunity to look at the contents, dynamics and structure of Andromeda in great detail. Variable stars show variation in their brightness over time. The variability timescales of these stars depend on the type of these variable stars. Cepheids, RR Lyrae and Long period variables are some types of variable stars which land up in different positions across the H-R diagram and show diverse light curve nature and periods. The <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/phat/"> Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)</a> has surveyed one third of Andromeda's disk with unprecedented resolution and depth using Hubble Space Telescope. It has catalogued the average and time-resolved photometry of 117 million point sources which makes it an immense treasury of information to be explored. We are now looking at the time-domain PHAT data to identify various types of variable stars across Andromeda's disk. We are also using ground based variability surveys like POMME which has overlap with the PHAT sky coverage. We are also obtaining repeated optical spectroscopy of some of the luminous variables in Andromeda using the Shane 3-m telescope. This work is in collaboration with <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~raja/"> Prof. Puragra (Raja) Guhathakurta </a> and a large collaboration including <a href="http://ucsc-sip.org/"> SIP </a> high school students.
